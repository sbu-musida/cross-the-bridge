# Bridge Crossing Game

## Description
The objective of the **Bridge Crossing Game** is to guide a character across multiple bridges by generating a stick. The length of the stick is determined by the player, who adjusts it by holding down the mouse. The game requires careful timing and precision to ensure the stick is long enough to bridge the gaps between platforms, but not too long to fall off or cause the character to fail.

## Features
- **Dynamic Stick Length**: The player controls the length of the stick by holding down the mouse button.
- **Multiple Bridges**: Navigate through a series of bridges, each with different gaps and challenges.
- **User-Controlled Gameplay**: The length of the stick changes in real-time based on the mouse input.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Press the "Start" button to begin.
2. **Adjust Stick Length**: Hold down the mouse button to adjust the stick's length. The longer you hold it, the longer the stick becomes.
3. **Cross the Bridges**: Use the stick to bridge the gaps between the platforms and guide the character across.
4. **Reach the End**: Successfully cross all the bridges to win!

## Controls
- **Mouse**: Hold down the left mouse button to control the stick length.

## Requirements
- A mouse (for adjusting the stick length)
